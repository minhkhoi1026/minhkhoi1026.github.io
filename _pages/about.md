Hi there! 

Welcome to my website!
My name is Khoi N.M. Nguyen. I am currently an AI Resident in [AI Center @ FPT Software](https://fpt-aicenter.com/) from August 2023, advised by [Prof.Tan Minh Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/). Previously, I graduated in the top 3 of my cohort from the University of Science, VNUHCM, earning a bachelor's degree in Information Technology through the honors program.
Currently, my research is focusing on the robustness and efficiency of neural networks. I am also interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems, especially in the context of large-scale parallel systems.
